CarTalk is an IMU expansion board for the Macchina M2 platform. The M2 board interfaces with the OBD-II port, which is standard in most modern cars. The CarTalk firmware uses the M2 to read data from the car's CAN bus and log it to the on-board SD card. The CarTalk expansion board provides additional location, motion, and environmental data. The expansion board also provides WiFi access so that the data logs can be uploaded to a remote server without user intervention (i.e. when the car returns home each day).
