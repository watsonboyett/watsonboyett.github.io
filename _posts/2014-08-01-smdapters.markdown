A set of small PCB adapters used to convert common SMD footprints to DIP modules for easier prototyping. SMD footprints include: SOIC, TSSOP, TQFP, SOT-223, and TO-252.  
  
Update: Adafruit offers [several similar products](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=smt%20breakout&) and they are considerably better for prototyping (larger pad sizes, routed edges)! Only use this library if you need to make a lot of these adapters; otherwise, buy them from Adafuit.
