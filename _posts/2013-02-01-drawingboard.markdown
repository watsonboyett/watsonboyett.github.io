I built an interactive projection surface using Microsoft's Kinect camera sensor and a projector. The Kinect  provides point cloud location and depth information that can be used to emulate mouse/touch events on the projection surface. Virtually any reflective surface can be used as an interactive display. I also built a "drawing board" web-app in Javascript that provides an simple interface for playing a new version of pictionary.
